IN THIS EXERCISE :
=> WE EXPLORE APP ROUTER IN NEXTJS WHICH IS A FILE AND FOLDER BASED ROUTING TECHNIQUE IN NEXTJS AND IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ITS PREVIOUS    COUNTERPART IN REACT WHICH WAS REACT ROUTER DOM

=> WE THEN EXPLORE THE PROCESS TO CREATE DIFFERENT ROUTES IN NEXTJS APP ROUTER E.G ABOUT,CONTACTS ETC IN THIS REPO
=> WE PRACTICE DYNAMIC ROUTING IN NEXT JS WHERE WE USE [FOLDERNAME] FORMAT FOR CREATING DYNAMIC ROUTE.
=> WE PRACTICE NESTED ROUTING E.G DOCS AND PRODUCTS IN THIS REPO
=> WE PRACTICE CATCH ALL SEGMENTS WHERE WE GET ALL THE PARAMETERS FROM URL IN PARAMS WHICH IS ACHIEVED BY CREATING A ROUTE WHOSE 
   NAME IS IN FORMANT [...FOLDERNAME]

=> WE PRACTICE ROUTE GROUPING E.G AUTH ROUTE IN THIS REPOSITORY .THE BRACKETS GIVE US THE ADVANTAGE THAT THE FOLDERNAME AUTH DOESNOT NEED TO BE 
   IN THE URL.

=> PRIVATE FOLDERS CAN BE CREATED USING - SIGN AS PREFIX FOR THE NAME OF THE FOLDER.
=> IF HOWEVER WE WANT A FOLDER WITH NAME STARTING WITH - AS PREFIX AND WE WANT IT AS ROUTE THE WE CAN USE ITS UTF ENCODING %5F AS PREFIX.
=> WE EXPRORE LAYOUTS IN NEXTJS AND HOW TO CREATE THEM AT ROOT LEVEL.
=> WE CAN CREATE GROUP LAYOUTS BY CREATING A SEPARATE LAYOUT.TSX IN THEIR FOLDER.
=> META DATA GIVES REVELANT INFO ABOUT A PAGE.
=> META DATA HELPS IN SEO . NEXT.JS OFFERS META DATA API FOR SUCH CAUSE.
=> META DATA CAN BE APPLIED IN LAYOUT FOR ALL PAGES OR IN PAGE FOR SINGLE PAGE.
=> TO CREATE CUSTOM METADATA EXPORT A metadata OBJECT IN THE PAGE OR LAYOUT.TSX FILE AND ADD TITLE AND DESCRIPTION IN IT.
