IN THIS EXERCISE :
=> WE EXPLORE APP ROUTER IN NEXTJS WHICH IS A FILE AND FOLDER BASED ROUTING TECHNIQUE IN NEXTJS AND IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ITS PREVIOUS    COUNTERPART IN REACT WHICH WAS REACT ROUTER DOM

=> WE THEN EXPLORE THE PROCESS TO CREATE DIFFERENT ROUTES IN NEXTJS APP ROUTER E.G ABOUT,CONTACTS ETC IN THIS REPO
=> WE PRACTICE DYNAMIC ROUTING IN NEXT JS WHERE WE USE [FOLDERNAME] FORMAT FOR CREATING DYNAMIC ROUTE.
=> WE PRACTICE NESTED ROUTING E.G DOCS AND PRODUCTS IN THIS REPO
=> WE PRACTICE CATCH ALL SEGMENTS WHERE WE GET ALL THE PARAMETERS FROM URL IN PARAMS WHICH IS ACHIEVED BY CREATING A ROUTE WHOSE 
   NAME IS IN FORMANT [...FOLDERNAME]

=> WE PRACTICE ROUTE GROUPING E.G AUTH ROUTE IN THIS REPOSITORY .THE BRACKETS GIVE US THE ADVANTAGE THAT THE FOLDERNAME AUTH DOESNOT NEED TO BE 
   IN THE URL.

=> PRIVATE FOLDERS CAN BE CREATED USING - SIGN AS PREFIX FOR THE NAME OF THE FOLDER.
=> IF HOWEVER WE WANT A FOLDER WITH NAME STARTING WITH - AS PREFIX AND WE WANT IT AS ROUTE THE WE CAN USE ITS UTF ENCODING %5F AS PREFIX.
=> WE EXPRORE LAYOUTS IN NEXTJS AND HOW TO CREATE THEM AT ROOT LEVEL.
=> WE CAN CREATE GROUP LAYOUTS BY CREATING A SEPARATE LAYOUT.TSX IN THEIR FOLDER.
=> META DATA GIVES REVELANT INFO ABOUT A PAGE.
=> META DATA HELPS IN SEO . NEXT.JS OFFERS META DATA API FOR SUCH CAUSE.
=> META DATA CAN BE APPLIED IN LAYOUT FOR ALL PAGES OR IN PAGE FOR SINGLE PAGE.
=> TO CREATE CUSTOM METADATA EXPORT A metadata OBJECT IN THE PAGE OR LAYOUT.TSX FILE AND ADD TITLE AND DESCRIPTION IN IT.
=> TO EXPORT DYNAMIC META DATA IMPORT MetaData from NEXT AND EXPORT A GENERATING FUNCTION WHICH TAKES PROPS SAME AS RETURN DEFAULT RETURN FUNCTION
   E.G IN PRODUCT_ID PAGE. THIS FUNCTION CAN ALSO BE ASYNC TO AWAIT A FETCH REQUEST IN SUCH CASE TYPE RETURN SHOULD BE PROMISE<METADATA>.
=> THE TITLE PROPERTY IN METADATA CAN BE A STRING OR AN OBJECT WHICH TAKES ABSOLUTE,DEFAULT AND TEMPLATE PROPERTIES.
=> THE ABSOLUTE APPLIES TO THE CURRENT PAGE WHILE DEFALT AND TEMPLATE APPLY TO CHILDREN PAGES. IN TEMPLATE WE USE "%s" FOR MAKING TEMPLATE
=> THE LINK TAG IS USED TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN PAGES . IT TAKES HREF AND REPLACE PROPS. REPLACE PROP WOULD TAKE THE PAGE OUT OF HISTORY STACK
   AND IF WE USE BACK BUTTON IT WILL GO TO HOMEPAGE.
=> USEROUTER HOOK IS USED TO NAVIGATE PRAMATICALLY BETWEEN PAGES BY PUSHING NEWPAGE INTO IT.IT IS SIMILAR TO USEHISTORY IN REACT ROUTER.
=> LAYOUT.TSX ONLY RELOADS THE CHILDREN PART OF THE PAGE HOWEVER IF WE USE TEMPLATE.TSX IT WILL RELOAD ALL PAGE. THIS CAN BE USEFULL IF WE WANT 
   THE PAGE TO CHANGE TO DEFAULT VALUES AFTER IT HAS LOADED A CHILD PAGE E.G IF THERE IS AN INPUT PROP.
=> LOADING.TSX HELPS US TO DISPLAY LOADING STATE.
